# Roadmap: Phase 1 — Project Memory 🏗️

## Phase 1: Core Memory Serialization [⚡]
- **Goal**: Implement the underlying CLI logic and distillation workflow.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Add `commitMemory` and subcommands to `bin/gsd-tools.js`.
  2. Create `workflows/gsd-commit-memory.md` with distillation protocol.
  3. Update `workflows/gsd-help.md` and `README.md`.
  4. Write automated tests for memory ingestion and storage.
  5. Verify v1.0.9 and push to origin.

## Phase 2: Knowledge Re-injection [📈]
- **Goal**: Make future workflows (new-project, plan) aware of existing memory.
- **Tasks**: (Out of scope for current Super Mode run, but tracked for v1.1.0)
