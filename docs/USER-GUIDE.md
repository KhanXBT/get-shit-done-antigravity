# User Guide

Complete guide for using GSD workflows inside Antigravity.

## Quick Start

```
/gsd-new-project
```

This kicks off the full initialization flow: deep questioning → domain research → requirements → roadmap.

---

## Workflow Overview

### Phase 1: Initialize

**Command:** `/gsd-new-project`

The most leveraged moment in any project. GSD asks deep questions to understand what you want to build:

- Core value proposition — the ONE thing that must work
- Target users, technical preferences, constraints
- Scope boundaries — what's explicitly NOT in v1
- Success criteria

**Output:** `.planning/PROJECT.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `STATE.md`

### Phase 2: Discuss

**Command:** `/gsd-discuss [N]`

Before planning, capture HOW you want things built. GSD identifies gray areas (things that could go multiple ways) and asks concrete questions:

- "Cards or list layout?"
- "Infinite scroll or pagination?"
- "Dark mode or light only or both?"

**Output:** `.planning/phases/NN-slug/NN-CONTEXT.md`

### Phase 3: Plan

**Command:** `/gsd-plan [N]`

Research the implementation domain and create atomic, executable task plans:

1. **Research** — best practices, libraries, patterns, pitfalls
2. **Plan** — XML-structured tasks with files, actions, verification, done criteria
3. **Verify** — check plans against requirements and context

**Output:** `NN-RESEARCH.md`, `NN-01-PLAN.md`, `NN-02-PLAN.md`, etc.

### Phase 4: Execute

**Command:** `/gsd-execute [N]`

Execute each plan's tasks with atomic git commits:

- Each task = one commit
- Commit messages = `feat(NN-PP): task name`
- Failed tasks can be retried, skipped, or stopped
- Automatic verification against must-haves at the end

**Output:** `NN-01-SUMMARY.md`, `NN-VERIFICATION.md`

### Phase 5: Verify

**Command:** `/gsd-verify [N]`

User acceptance testing — you confirm each feature works:

```
TEST 1/5: User Registration Form

Expected: Form shows name, email, password fields.
  Submit validates all fields before sending.

→ Type "pass" or describe what's wrong
```

**Output:** `NN-UAT.md`

### Repeat

Continue with the next phase: `/gsd-discuss N+1` → `/gsd-plan N+1` → `/gsd-execute N+1` → `/gsd-verify N+1`

---

## Quick Mode

**Command:** `/gsd-quick [description]`

For small tasks that don't need full ceremony:

```
/gsd-quick Add dark mode toggle
```

- Creates a quick plan (1-3 tasks)
- Executes with atomic commits
- Tracks in `.planning/quick/`

---

## Specialized Modes

### ⚡ Super Mode

**Command:** `/gsd-super [prompt]`

For full autonomy. Give it a prompt or PRD and walk away. GSD Antigravity takes over the entire lifecycle:
- Auto-detects context and auto-branches (`gsd-super/feature`)
- Runs discuss → plan → execute → verify autonomously
- Performs visual browser testing and automated test suites
- Self-debugs and escapes hallucination loops

### 🛡️ Anti-Hallucination Q&A

**Command:** `/gsd-no-halluc [question]` (alias: `/no-halluc`)

For general technical research and verified Q&A. This mode bypasses the standard workflow and activates a dedicated research engine:
- **Strict Verification**: Every claim must be verified against official docs or the codebase.
- **Citations**: Cites specific files, lines, or URLs for every answer.
- **Confidence Scoring**: Tags answers with HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW confidence based on verification source.
- **Uncertainty Marking**: Explicitly states when a claim cannot be verified instead of guessing.

## Progress

**Command:** `/gsd-progress`

See where you are: current phase, completed phases, next steps.

## Tips

1. **Don't skip discuss.** The 5 minutes you spend in `/gsd-discuss` saves hours of wrong implementation.
2. **Be specific.** When GSD asks questions, concrete answers ("cards layout, 3 per row, hover to expand") beat vague ones ("make it look good").
3. **Trust the workflow.** The structured approach prevents context rot and keeps quality high across long sessions.
4. **Use quick mode** for bug fixes, config changes, and small features.
5. **Check progress** with `/gsd-progress` when you lose track of where you are.
